This little boilerplate takes care of the Electron setup so you can start developing a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The scripts include commands to build executables of your app on different systems.

## Motivation :question:

Taking care of initial setup so I can start developing random desktop apps and making release builds of them.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

```bash

> git clone https://github.com/Josue-Rodriguez-98/react-electron-boilerplate
